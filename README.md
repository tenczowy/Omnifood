# Omnifood
Landing page of made up company called "Omnifood". Project is a part of Udemy course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" created by Jonas Schmedtmann.

##
Omnifood website was created using only HTML and CSS with a few lines of JavaScript. 
The primary objective behind the creation of this website was to delve into the realm of HTML and CSS, aiming to enhance and refine my skills in web development. 
Through hands-on practice and experimentation, I sought to grasp the intricacies of these fundamental languages, ultimately striving to create a polished and visually appealing online presence. 
This project served as an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to gain practical insights into website design and layout while honing my proficiency in HTML and CSS.
